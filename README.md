# Outcomes based on Launch Date and Goals
  ## 1. Overview of Project
   The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise figure out if a plays' launch date and funding goals has a significant effect to its success. This will 
   help Louise make the best decision for her upcoming play.
   
 ## 2. Analysis and Challenges
   The graph below represents play outcomes based on their launch date.

    The highest number of successful plays was done on the month of May and June. The Month of May also has the most amount of failed plays followed 
    by october. The month of November has the least amount of fails.
   
   The graph below represents the outcomes based on their goals
      ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108508844/189494731-32031d42-ec15-42e4-acc6-dad65bc743fc.png)
    The highest percentage of successful plays are goals less than 1000 following by goals from 1000 to 49999. The highest amount of
    failed plays are goals ranging from 25000 to 29999, 45000 to 49000 and 50000 and more.
    
   The challenges encountered is the sample size in the graph outcome based on goals. The amount of 45000 to 49999 only has the total amount of 1 prjoect
   which resulted a 100% fail raten for that amount. Having more sample sizes in that category would make the graph more reliable.
    
  ## 3. Results
   Conclusion based on outcomes on date; We can conclude that plays that lauched on May and June are most likely to suceed therefore it is highly  
   recommended to launch a play during these months. The month of May has the highest number of successful plays but it also has the most number of failed 
   plays which is 52/166. Plays launched on October are most likely to fail.
     
   Conclusion based on outcomes based on their goals; We can conclude that plays that has goals less than 1000 has a 76% success rate while plays that
   goals are 25000 and more have a 80%-100% fail rate.
   
   Limitations : This visualization is only based on the subcategory, Plays so it may not apply if you are researching about the subcategory Theater. It is 
   possible to narrow to study down to a region to get more accurate results
   Other possible graphs that can be recommended are Bar Graphs especially when analyzing about the goal. It will give better visualization of the ratio
   of successful, failed and canceled for each goal amount.
